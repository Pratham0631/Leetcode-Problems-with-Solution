=> You are given a binary array arr[], containing only 0s and 1s. You are allowed to flip at most one 0 to 1.
   Your task is to determine the maximum length of consecutive 1s that can be obtained in the array after performing at most one such flip.

=>  Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: 
    If we flip the first zero, nums becomes [1,1,0,1,1] and we have 2 consecutive ones.
    If we flip the second zero, nums becomes [0,1,1,1,1] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
    The max number of consecutive ones is 4.

=> public static int maxConsec2(int[] nums){
	    int n = nums.length;
	    int l = 0;
	    int r = 0;
	    
	    int maxOnes = 0;  
	    int cntZero = 0;
	    
	    while(r < n){
	        
	        if(nums[r] == 0){
	            cntZero++;
	        }
	        
	        while(cntZero > 1){
	            if(nums[l] == 0) cntZero--;
	            l++;
	        }
	        
	        maxOnes = Math.max(maxOnes, r - l + 1);
	        
	        r++;
	    }
	    
	    return maxOnes;
	}
